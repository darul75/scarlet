      <h1><a name="whatIsScarletLink">What Is Scarlet</a></h1>
      <p>Scarlet is a framework that gives you the ability to intercept(either listen or change) javascript functions and prototypes(objects) at runtime. This happens without changing the original source code. There are many reasons you would want to do this. One good example of its use is error handling or general logging. Another might be mocking or even for debugging. This website walks you through how it works in a concise and interactive way. Use the <i><b>walkthrough</i></b> to navigate Scarlet's concepts as pages and <i><b>skip links</i></b> to navigate within a particular page.</p>

      <h1><a name="ifYouLikeObjectsLink">For Objects</a></h1>
      <p>This framework would really appeal to you if you like doing javascript in an object oriented way, or at the very least encapsulate your functions inside 'class' or 'constructor' functions. This is where Scarlet really makes sense. Scarlet discovers the members(constructors, properties and functions) and creates a proxy layer over the type or instance that is hidden. Then giving you the ability to listen or change the object or a particular members behaviour. </p>

      <p>Every code sample you see in this site is interactive. You can change it and run it(Win Ctrl-X and Mac Cmd+X). See how Scarlet works with <i><b>functions</b></i> next. We have taken our Github Math.min example and created an interactive demo with additional pages for prototypes and proxies. You would need a basic level of understanding for how Javascript works in terms of declaring functions and calling them to continue. </p>
