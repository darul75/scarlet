      <h1><a name="whatIsScarletLink">What Is Scarlet</a></h1>
      <p>Scarlet is a framework that gives you the ability to intercept(either listen or change) javascript functions and prototypes(objects) at runtime. This happens without changing the original source code. There are many reasons you would want to do this. One good example of its use is error handling or general logging. Another might be mocking or even for debugging. This website walks you through how it works in an concise and interactive way. Use the <i><b>walkthrough</i></b> to navigate Scarlet's concepts as pages and <i><b>skip links</i></b> to navigate within a particular page.</p>

      <p>Every code sample you see in this site is interactive. You can change it and run it(Win Ctrl-X and Mac Cmd+X). See how Scarlet works with <i><b>functions</b></i> next. We have taken our Github Math.min example and created an interactive demo with some enhancements. You would need a basic level of understanding for how Javascript works in terms of declaring functions and calling them to continue. </p>
