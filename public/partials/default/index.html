      <p>Scarlet is a framework that gives you the ability to intercept(either listen or change) javascript functions and 
      prototypes(objects) at runtime. This happens without changing the original source code. There are many reasons you 
      would want to do this. One good example of its use is error handling or general logging. Another might be mocking or 
      even for debugging. This website hopes to walk you through how it works in a concise way. Use the 'walkthrough' to 
      navigate scarlet concepts as pages and 'skip links' to navigate within a particular page.</p>

      <p>Take a look at how Scarlet works with functions. We have taken our github math.min example and created an
      interactive demo. You can play around with it and see what the effects are. This example shows you how to manipulate
      the behaviour of any function in a controlled way. You would need a basic level understanding of how javascript works
      in terms of declaring functions and calling them to continue. </p>
